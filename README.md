# üö¶ Traffic Light Controller (FSM in Verilog)

## üìå Project Overview
This project implements a **traffic light controller** using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** in Verilog.  
The traffic light cycles through traffic flows for varios routes, with each light active for a fixed number of clock cycles.

The design models a **Moore FSM**, where outputs (light signals) depend only on the current state.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Simulation
1. Compile the design and testbench using your Verilog simulator (e.g., **Icarus Verilog**, **ModelSim**, or **Vivado**).  
2. Run the simulation and generate a waveform (`.vcd`) file.  
3. Open the waveform in **GTKWave** (or another viewer) to visualize states and light outputs.
